## How to run

Code snippets in the book are in `src/ChXX.hs` or under `src/ChXX` directory,
and exercise answers are in `src/ExXX.hs` or under `src/ExXX` directory,
where `XX` is the chapter number such as `01`.

To try the code, start GHCi with the file you want to play with.

```sh
$ stack ghci src/Ch10/Nim.hs
> nim
```
