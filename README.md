## How to run

Code snippets in the book are in `src/ChXX.hs` or under `src/ChXX` directory,
and exercise answers are in `src/ExXX.hs` or under `src/ExXX` directory,
where `XX` is the chapter number such as `01`.

To run the code, start GHCi and invoke the function you want to test.

```sh
$ stack ghci
> nim
```
